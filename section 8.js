// along with JSONWEBTOKEN for authentication. Here are the steps:

//1.Setting Up Dependencies:

// Install necessary packages such as Express.js,JSONWEBTOKEN, and a database library like Mongoose for MongoDB or Mysql.
//2. Design JWT:

// Set up JWT with the authentication strategy, whether it's local (username and password) (eg. Google or Facebook login)

// 3.Create User Model:

// Define a User model in your database (e.g., MongoDB or Mysql) to store user information like username, email, and password.
//4. Routes and Controllers:

// Create routes and controller files for user registration, login, and logout.
// Implement middleware to ensure authenticated access to protected routes.

//5. Session Management:

// Use session management to keep users logged in between requests.
// Serialize and deserialize user information to and from sessions.
// Use libraries like JWT for client-side authentication.

//6. Testing:

// Write unit tests and integration tests for your authentication routes for security purpose.
// Deploy your application on a hosting platform.
// Implement security best practices like rate password hashing, and securing API endpoints.

// Documentation:

// Create documentation for the authentication feature to help other developers understand how to use it.
// Regularly update dependencies

// Now, regarding a project I've previously worked on:

// Project: Product Management or E-ommerce

// Role and Contributions:
// I worked on a team that developed an  website for a client. 
//My role was primarily as a back-end developer. Here are some of my key contributions:

// Database Design: I designed the database schema, including tables for products, orders, and user accounts using Mongodb or Mysql.

// Back-End Development: I implemented the server using Node.js and Express.js. 
//This involved creating APIs for product listings, user authentication, and order processing.

// User Authentication: I integrated JWT Token for user authentication, 
//allowing customers to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

// Order Processing: I developed the order processing system, 
//including the ability to add products to a shopping cart, place orders, and view order history.

// API Testing: I wrote unit tests for the API endpoints using tool like postman to ensure that they functioned correctly.

// Deployment: I helped deploy the application on a Github.

// Overall, my contributions helped deliver a fully functional e-commerce website that allowed users to browse products, make purchases, and manage their accounts.
